### Design

#### Colour Scheme
- The main colours i used for this website are Space Cadet #142546/ Light Sea Green #3Eb9ad (rgb(62, 185, 173)) and White to keep the colour scheme simple but effective and not take away from the beautiful imagery.

#### Typography

- Lato google font was used throughout the website with San Serif being the fall back font. I used the Lato font in a previous project and felt it was clear and not too fancy to be legible.

#### Imagery

- Images are one of the main focuses of this website. A lot of images are displayed across the website with the first being the image Carousel on the homepage displaying all tour location across the site. There are further images in the Recommended tours section and the tours.html page.
